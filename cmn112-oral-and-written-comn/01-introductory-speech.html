<p>Hi, I'm Nishant, and I'm a Master's student doing my second semester here.
I've not taken CMN 111 and so, don't have a topic to talk to you'll about.
Instead I'm going to talk about the last essay I wrote -- my statement of
purpose, and what I'm expect to get out of this course.</p>
<p>I've not had much experience writing and public speaking has generally been
something I've avoided. When applying to colleges I was forced to get over this,
and write an essay that would get me into a good university. Even with the
guidance of a mentor, it took two months and a considerable amount of pain to
write.</p>
<p>But writing the essay was an interesting experience -- it forced me to explain
concisely and clearly what I wanted to get out of my Masters degree. Before
writing the essay, I was nervous about switching from my background in Computer
Engineering to Mathematics, something that I was only casually interested in.
Every time I spoke to someone about my degree I would half hope that they'd talk
me out of it. When I was done with it, I was excited and intrigued about what
I'd be studying and confident that I'd find it interesting.</p>
<p>In spite of the effort it took, I enjoyed writing that essay, and it's something
I'd really like to get good at. In this course I want to make this process more
enjoyable and less painful, to learn how to speak well, and get my point across.</p>
