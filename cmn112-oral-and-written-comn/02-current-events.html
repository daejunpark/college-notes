<p>Although Uber is one of the 93 companies supporting this, public opinion has forced it's CEO, Travis Kalanick, out of his position on Trump's Strategic and Policy Forum.</p>
<p>Twitter users are calling for Uber users to uninstall the app under the DeleteUber hash tag and protestors are campaigning for his resignation from Trump's forum.</p>
<p>Trump's executive order has affected 1000s of Uber drivers and the CEO had been hoping to raise his concerns to the president at the forum's first meeting on the 3rd (Feb).</p>
<p>However, the protestors treated his presence on the forum as a sign of his support for Trumps agenda. Kalanick retorted that this sign had been misinterpreted -- his agenda at the forum was to steer Trump away from this policy. He says he joined out of the &quot;belief that by speaking up and engaging, we can make a difference&quot;.</p>
<p>He backs up his motivation, condemning the ban and contributing to relief groups and even promising that the company will compensate the drivers stuck overseas and will create a $3 million legal defence fund.</p>
<p>Protesters are also annoyed at Uber for continuing to serve customers at JFK during a taxi strike in protest of the executive order. They claimed that Uber was trying to break the strike by disabling surge pricing at JFK.</p>
<p>While we could argue that this is a victory for Trump protesters, one wonders whether closing down channels of communication with Trump is the best move in the long term.</p>
