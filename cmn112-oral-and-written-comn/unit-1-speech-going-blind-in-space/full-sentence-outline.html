<ul>
<li>Introduction
<ul>
<li>I'm sure you've all had that moment, say during your public speech
assignment in class, where you stumble, seize up and panic, haven't you?</li>
<li>[Thesis] In the speech I'm analyzing Chris Hadfield's talks about exactly
this -- dealing with fear.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Context
<ul>
<li>From an evolutionary standpoint, fear is great when you're living in the
savannah and you see a lion -- it really makes your fight or flight instinct
kick in and keeps you alive.</li>
<li>But you could argue it's outlived some of it's usefulness.</li>
<li>Buzz Aldrin, the second man on the moon, speaks of piloting of the lunar
lander &quot;A mind concerned about danger is a clouded mind. It's paralyzing.&quot;</li>
<li>You don't have time to think about the fear
<ul>
<li>when you're piloting the lunar lander,</li>
<li>or even when you're in the middle of an interview or speech</li>
<li>Or a day before your finals when you realize you won't be able to get
through the syllabus, do you?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Structure
<ul>
<li>In the Ted Talk, Chris Hadfield talks, a Canadian astronaut,  to us about
how he's learned to deal with fear.</li>
<li>And he's a very appropriate person to talk about this -- He's a Canadian
astronaut who's flown two space shuttle missions and served as commander of
the International Space Station.</li>
<li>His whole speech is structured as an analogy, drawing parallels between how
he faces his fears through training and rational thought, and how we can
each deal with our own.</li>
<li>He talks about why we would want to deal with them, what we'd get out of it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>First Argument: Analogy
<ul>
<li>Background:
<ul>
<li>He's tells us of the dangerous situations he's been in -- more dangerous
and &quot;scary&quot; than most of us will see in our lifetimes.
<ul>
<li>A shuttle flight had an ~ 1 in 40 chance of having a
catastrophic failure;</li>
<li>being out in a space suit, with just a thin layer of fabric between
you and the deadly vacuum of space, and going blind;</li>
<li>and of coming back to earth in the Soyuz capsule hurtling through the
atmosphere, essentially a meteorite.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>He tells us how his training taught him to deal with these fears.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The argument and why it's great
<ul>
<li>He walks us through each of these situations in enough gory detail for
you to see through his eyes.</li>
<li>He then asks us about our fears -- &quot;Maybe spiders?&quot; he said in an almost
comical contrast to what he'd been talking about earlier.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A bit extreme?
<ul>
<li>The analogy is really extreme, but is really effective perhaps even
because of that.</li>
<li>you think to yourself if he can get over his fears, of these crazy
dangerous situations, then why can't I get over my little ones?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Why it's convincing?
<ul>
<li>In his book &quot;An astronaut's guide to Life on Earth&quot;, Hadfield call this
approach &quot;Working the problem&quot; - a NASA term for working through your available options, of trees of decisions and their possible consequences until you find a solution that works.</li>
<li>He talks about practicing dealing with a situation until you've
overridden your natural instincts.</li>
<li>He walks us through rationalizing this --  most spiders aren't poisonous,
the ones that are have bright marking letting you know, and even then
most can't harm a human beyond a painful sting.</li>
<li>Once you've thought through it, it's not difficult to bring yourself to
walk through one spider web, then another, building up your confidence
and breaking down your fear.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Second Argument: Motivation
<ul>
<li>In his second argument to get over our fears -- one of motivation -- He
tells us of the whole new world of opportunities that opens up once we've
gotten over these fears.</li>
<li>He asks &quot;Why would you take these kind of risks?&quot;.
<ul>
<li>Because you can get on that space shuttle and the dreams of nine year old
you come true.</li>
<li>You could become a doctor</li>
<li>or complete your PhD and be on the cutting edge of research in your
field.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>These dream seem dauntingly scary and far off, but by overcoming your
fears, you can get there.</li>
<li>It's a pretty powerful motive if you ask me, right?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Conclusion
<ul>
<li>I think Hadfield does a great job.</li>
<li>Building up suspense and tension and then relieving it with a bit of comedy,
all the while keeping the audience engaged.</li>
<li>His arguments are solid and he leaves you wondering what your puny fears are
about.</li>
<li>Even though he's talking about all these crazy situations he's been in and
things he's dealt with, he doesn't come across as intimidating, but instead
friendly and caring, as he almost hand-holds you though dealing with your
fears.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
