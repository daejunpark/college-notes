<ul>
<li>Introduction
<ul>
<li>I'm sure you've seen the movie, Terminator, where Skynet takes over the
world and enslaves humans.</li>
<li>Well, a lot of people are worried about machines taking over, although not
in such a dramatic way.</li>
<li>Robots and automation are replacing humans in more and more jobs.</li>
<li>Cashiers and taxi/truck drivers are the obvious examples that come to mind.</li>
<li>One of the courses I'm taking, Automated Deduction, is figuring out how to
use computers and automatically prove theorems and replace mathematicians,
the very thing them I'm training to be.</li>
<li>So its plain that's its not just low-skill jobs that are going to be
replaced, even people with advanced degrees aren't safe.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Context &amp; thesis
<ul>
<li>The idea my partner, Jaelyn, proposed, that &quot;the US govt should tax
automation&quot;, is intended to slow this down.</li>
<li>I'm going to argue against it, not because I'm pro-robot, anti-employment.</li>
<li>I'm a student who'll be looking for a job in the next couple of years, just
like you will.</li>
<li>[Thesis] Instead, I'm going to argue against it, because the proposal isn't
in our best interests. We've know, from examples in the past that opposing
automation is this way is futile. I'll argue that implementing this could
even do more harm than good.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Preview
<ul>
<li>So here's the plan:
<ul>
<li>First I'm going to tell you what this planned tax is,</li>
<li>then I'll give you a few reasons why it's not a good idea,</li>
<li>and lastly I'll talk about alternate solutions, that I feel will work
better.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Define the problem
<ul>
<li>The idea for this proposal comes from Bill Gates.</li>
<li>Worried about automation he suggested that we tax the use of robots and
artificial intelligence in factories and other industry at a level similar
to the jobs they replace.</li>
<li>He suggests the proceeds from this to train workers in new skills that have
not yet been automated.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Why not?
<ul>
<li>On the surface this seems great, right?</li>
<li>You reduce the incentive to use automation...</li>
<li>...while at the same time get some extra cash to spend on getting people new
jobs.</li>
<li>It ignores some big-picture issues though.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Visualization of immediate consequences
<ul>
<li>How would you feel if you found some new, easier method of doing a math
problem in class and your teacher cut marks for not doing it the way that
was taught in class? You'd feel awful, right?</li>
<li>But that's essentially what this tax is!
<ul>
<li>This tax is a penalty on innovation.</li>
<li>It would make US companies less competitive</li>
<li>not all other countries are going to have this tax</li>
<li>Guess what the companies are going to do next?</li>
<li>They're going to leave the US and setup factories in one of these
countries, and those factories which once provided jobs in the US will
close down.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Implementation problems
<ul>
<li>Another issue with implementing this tax, is what kind of automation should
you tax?</li>
<li>Bloomberg's Noah Smith (2017) writes, &quot;The problem with Gates' basic proposal is
that it’s very hard to tell the difference between new technology that
complements humans and new technology that replaces them. This is especially
true over the long term. Power looms replaced human weavers back in the
Industrial Revolution, but people eventually became more productive, by
learning to operate those looms. If taxes had slowed the development of
power looms, the eventual improvements would have come later.&quot;</li>
<li>Where do we draw the line between automation that should be taxed and
automation that shouldn't?</li>
<li>It doesn't have a straight forward answer</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Now what?
<ul>
<li>The question remains though, what do we do about unemployment?</li>
<li>We can't just wait for new jobs to appear if the pace of automation is so
high.</li>
<li>Besides taking a while, it would also increase inequity, the income gap
between the rich and poor.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Two solutions suggested by Pethokoukis (2015) of the American Enterprise
Institute are wage subsidies and universal basic income.
<ul>
<li>
<p>The government could earn money through a &quot;sovereign wealth fund&quot;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Government would make investments in stocks and real-estate, or
possibly some of the factories that own the robots</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A wage subsidy is a type of welfare where a few dollars per hour are added
to the workers wage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sodha of the Guardian (2017), tells about how Finland carried out an
experiment with Universal Basic Income where the government would pay
citizens a stipend of a few hundred euros.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Conclusion
<ul>
<li>The fact of the matter is that automation is inevitable.</li>
<li>History has shown that when large economic forces have a stake, they tend to
win.</li>
<li>The Luddites, in the nineteenth century protested against the factories and
destroyed machines that were taking their jobs, were steam-rolled by the
industrial revolution.</li>
<li>Implementing this tax would be a denial of this fact, and would in effect be
shooting ourselves in the foot.</li>
<li>We should look for other methods to offset the mal-effects of automation,
while still keeping our industry competitive</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

supports the Tax. Bill Gates defines what his tax is, and why he wants it
implemented. He doesn't go into detail about how the tax would work.</p>

Aggregates various sources supporting wage subsidies. Intended to convince
readers that wage-subsidies are a good thing. He shows that wage subsidies can
break the vicious cycle of poverty. Implementations of this policy haven't been
carried out, so we don't know how effective it is.</p>
