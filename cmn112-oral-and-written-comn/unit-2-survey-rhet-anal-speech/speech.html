<p>Ever since the industrial revolution, automation has been replacing jobs with
machines. Skilled workers and Artisans such as weavers were replaced by
factories. In recent years the pace of automation has been accelerating and
broadening in scope. Cashiers have been replaced by self-checkout counters,
factory workers with robotic arms. 4M drivers in the US are predicted to be
replaced by self-driving cars in the next decade. Even doctors are being
replaced by computers that can perform diagnosis and even surgery.</p>
<p>People are worried about their jobs, and rightly so.</p>
<p>Microsoft's founder Bill gates proposes that we tax automation to slow down the
pace of it's adoption and to fund retraining of workers. (FORBES Morris, D., 2017)</p>
<p>While this may sound like a good idea, it's essentially a tax on innovation and
efficiency. You may say &quot;So what?&quot;, so long as it prevents unemployment from
skyrocketing it's a good thing, right? But it seems analogous to the Luddites,
a group of English textile workers and weavers, protesting the use of machines
in factories in the 17th century. It's difficult to slow down technology once
it's obvious that there's a huge economic advantage to using it.</p>
<p>Another issue with this idea is that it's difficult to define what automation is.
Bloomberg's Noah Smith writes &quot;The problem with Gates’ basic proposal is that it’s
very hard to tell the difference between new technology that complements humans
and new technology that replaces them. This is especially true over the long
term. Power looms replaced human weavers back in the Industrial Revolution, but
people eventually became more productive, by learning to operate those looms. If
taxes had slowed the development of power looms, the eventual improvements would
have come later.&quot; (Smith, N., 2017)
Where do we draw the line between automation that should be taxed and automation
that shouldn't?</p>
<p>The question remains though, what do we do about unemployment? We can't just wait
for new jobs to appear if the pace of automation is so high. Besides taking a
while, it would also increase inequity, the income gap between the rich and
poor.
Bill Gates says, &quot;business can’t [adequately handle such problems]. If you want
to do [something about] inequity, a lot of the excess labor is going to need to
go help the people who have lower incomes,” he said. “And so it means that you
can amp up social services for old people and handicapped people and you can
take the education sector and put more labor in there. Yes, some of it will go
to, ‘Hey, we’ll be richer and people will buy more things.’ But the
inequity-solving part, absolutely government’s got a big role to play there.&quot;
(Ernst, D. 2017)</p>
<p>One possible solution is a wage subsidy, a type of welfare -- adding
dollars-per-hour to the worker’s wage out of tax payer money. According to
James Pethokoukis of American Enterprise Institute, &quot;wage supports thus offer a
unique opportunity to break America’s negative cycle of poverty, family and
community breakdown&quot;.</p>
<p>Another idea is to redistribute the profits of automation more evenly. This
could be implemented as &quot;sovereign-wealth fund&quot;, where the government makes
investments in stocks and real-estate and distributes the profits to the public.
According to Sodha of the Guardian, in 2016/17 Finland carried out an experiment
of a similar concept -- Universal Basic Income. The government would pay
unemployed people between the age of 25 and 58 a &quot;basic income&quot; of 560 Euros
every month. This replaced unemployment benefit, but would be payed regardless
of whether the person is employed. (Sodha, S., 2017)</p>
<p>We should take a serious look at alternatives to the &quot;robot tax&quot; that avoid
stifling innovation, and slowing down economic growth, while at the same time
mitigate the harms of rapid automation.</p>
