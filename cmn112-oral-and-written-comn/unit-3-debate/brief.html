<h2>Introduction</h2>
<h3>History &amp; Cause of the Question</h3>
<p>Albert Shanker, president of the Americal Federation of Teachers
introduced the idea of charter schools in 1988. Inspired by a visit to
a public school in Cologne, Germany, he argued that allowing schools
independence -- having teachers make decisions democratically -- would
improve the quality of education provided to students.
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/31/opinion/sunday/albert-shanker-the-original-charter-school-visionary.html?_r=0">What are charter schools</a></p>
<p>Charter schools were implemented in the US in the 1990s and since then
there has been considerable debate as to whether or not they should
be funded by the government.</p>
<h3>Definitions and terms</h3>
<dl>
<dt>Charter School</dt>
<dd>
<p>A charter school is an independently run public school granted
greater flexibility in its operations, in return for greater
accountability for performance. The &quot;charter&quot; establishing each school
is a performance contract detailing the school's mission, program,
students served, performance goals, and methods of assessment.
(http://www.uncommonschools.org/our-approach/faq-what-is-charter-school)</p>
</dd>
<dt>Traditional Public Schools (TPS) / District Schools</dt>
<dd>
<p>Tradional Public Schools or District Schools are schools funded by
the government, and governed by school the district.</p>
<p>Strictly speaking charter schools are public schools, but this brief
uses the terms &quot;Traditional public school&quot;, &quot;district school&quot; and
&quot;public school&quot; interchangeably. The term &quot;charter school&quot; shall be
used explicitly otherwise.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Main Issues of the debate</h3>
<ul>
<li>Should the government continue to invest in charter schools.</li>
<li>Do charter schools do as well as traditional public schools.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Affirmative Case Arguments</h2>
<ol start="0">
<li>
<p>Introduction: We won't argue that Charter Schools are better than
public schools, but instead that they at least are as good as public
schools, and having charter schools introduce more competition and
in turn make the whole school system better .</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Offer more choice to students and parents.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A child's early education is something that stays with them
their entire lifetime. It effects their ability to learn and
to think and has huge downstream effects -- the university they
get into, their career.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.edchoice.org/school-choice/types-of-school-choice/">edchoice</a>, &quot;Families who can afford it often
choose their neighborhood public schools by moving to a
residence within their desired school’s assigned district.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While this is a great option for wealthier students, its not
possible for lower-income students. &quot;Families do not need to use
ESAs, vouchers or tax-credit scholarships to pay to enroll their
children in charter schools as these schools are already
publicly funded.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>According to <a href="https://www2.ed.gov/parents/schools/choice/definitions.html">ed.gov</a>, unless a public school &quot;has been
identified by the state for school improvement, corrective
action, or restructuring&quot;, their children are not eligible to
choose a school in another district.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This means poorer students do not have a choice of school unless
the district schools are in bad enough condition that they do not
meet the government set standards.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Otherwise disadvantaged students do better</p>
<ul>
<li>According to the Stanford Report (page 82), &quot;Charter schools and
their feeder schools are educating more disadvantaged students
than in 2009. Across the 27 states in this study, more than half
of the charter students live in poverty as indicated by their
eligibility for free and reduced price lunch programs (54
percent), a greater share than the US as a whole and an increase
for charter schools from 2009. Since 2009, the proportion of
Hispanic students in charters has begun to approach the
proportion of black students. Compared to their feeders, charter
schools enroll a lower percentage of white and Hispanic students
and a higher percentage of black students. These shifts reflect
growth in the proportion of disadvantaged parents that is aware,
is informed and is comfortable exercising their options for
school choice. The typical charter student arrives at a charter
school with lower levels of educational performance than was the
case in 2009.&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li></li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h2>Rebuttals</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Argument: &quot;Instead of defending public schools, to fund charter
schools, we should just improve public schools. Funding Charter
schools takes away money and resources from public schools. Instead
we should fix public schools.&quot;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Charter schools are actual funded LESS than public schools.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>According to a <a href="http://www.uaedreform.org/wp-content/uploads/charter-funding-inequity-expands.pdf">UoAReport</a>(University of Arkansas report), there
is a funding gap of 28.4% between public schools and charter
schools -- &quot;the average public charter school student in the U.S.
is receiving $3,814 less in funding than the average traditional
public school student.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The evidence indicates that while Charter Schools do take money
away from traditional public schools, they provide a similar
level of education even while receiving considerably less
funding.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Argument: &quot;They are less diverse compared to public schools ...&quot;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Charter schools are required to choose students by lottery.
This would mean that the diversity of the charter schools merely
reflects the diversity of the people applying to these schools,
and not the admission standards of charter schools.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://credo.stanford.edu/documents/NCSS%202013%20Final%20Draft.pdf">StanfordReport</a>(page 81) actually finds that students of ethnic
background and poorer students actually do better in charter
schools than in traditional public schools:</p>
<p>&quot;The biggest impacts are among Hispanic students who are English
language learners; they gain 50 additional days of learning in
reading and 43 additional days in math from charter attendance
per year. Black students in poverty at charter schools gain 29
additional days in reading and 36 additional days of learning in
math. White charter students lose 14 days of learning in reading
and have 50 fewer days learning in math.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Students in poverty, English language learners, and special
education students all benefit from attending charter schools as
well. Because these are students generally considered to be
underserved by the TPS (Traditional Public School) system, higher
quality educational options for these groups are of particular
interest.&quot;</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Argument: &quot;Competition between schools doesn't improve them&quot;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A study <a href="https://www2.ed.gov/rschstat/eval/choice/district_impact.pdf">US Department of Education Study</a>, &quot;Most districts
implemented new educational programs, made changes in
educational structures in district schools, and/or created new
schools with programs that were similar to those in the local
charter schools.&quot;.</p>
<p>It goes on to say &quot;districts with declining enrollment that did
not grant the charter were more likely to perceive that charter
schools had a negative affect on their budget and view charter
schools as competition. These districts responded competitively,
making a number of changes in district operations and
introducing programs into the educational system designed to
compete for students and parents.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://educationnext.org/the-effect-of-charter-schools-on-students-in-traditional-public-schools-a-review-of-the-evidence/">EduNext</a>(A 2016 report) by B. Gill a senior fellow at Mathematica Policy
Research and his colleague, aggregating information from 11
studies, each from different cities in different states finds
&quot;the literature provides some support for the “healthy
competition” hypothesis and almost none for the hypothesis that
students in district schools are harmed by the growth of
charters. Six studies found some evidence of positive effects,
four found no effects, and one found negative effects. Breaking
the results out by locations, in six cases that encompass five
cities and states, there is evidence that charter schools
produce (small) positive effects on the achievement of students
in nearby public schools. In nine other cases, encompassing
eight cities and states and one nationwide sample, charter
schools have been found to have no effect on students in nearby
district schools, positive or negative. The literature has only
a single case—involving a single school district—in which
charter schools have been found to have negative effects on the
achievement of students in nearby district schools.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This evidence shows that at the very least charted schools cause
small improvements to the quality of education at public schools,
and at the same time provide more choice to parents and students.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Blocks</h2>
<p>Response to: Students in charter schools don't do as well as those in
public schools.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://credo.stanford.edu/documents/NCSS%202013%20Final%20Draft.pdf">StanfordReport</a>(page 78-79) says that &quot;Students with one year
of charter enrollment realize smaller learning gains than their
peers in TPS in both reading and math, with the disadvantage
equal to 43 and 58 fewer days of learning, respectively.
Learning gains improve significantly for charter students by
their second year of enrollment – seeing about 22 more days of
learning in reading and 14 more days in math. Once a student is
enrolled for four or more years, their learning gains outpace
TPS by 50 days in reading and 43 days in math per year.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>Response to: Charter Schools take funding away from public schools</p>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>
<p>While they do take funding away from public schools they
are more efficient that public schools receiving on average 30%
less funds per student than traditional public schools. At the
same time they producing similar results to public schools (or
in the case of disadvantaged students, better results).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This means that the money that would have been spent on public
schools is better invested in charter schools.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li>Unfortunately we live in a world with limited resources, as per
basic economic principals, we need to deal with &quot;unlimited wants,
and limited resources&quot;. The funding for charter schools needs to
come from some where, and since they reduce the number of students
that attend district schools, the best place for the funding to
come from funds that would have otherwise been used to fund those
students.</li>
</ol>
<p>Response to: Charter schools are held to lower standards than public
schools.</p>
<ul>
<li>Charter schools are closed when underperforming with respect to
alternatives. Public schools aren't.</li>
<li>While on average new charter schools preform worse than
alternatives, as the poorer ones are weeded out or improve, the
average quality of charter schools improves.</li>
<li>According to <a href="http://credo.stanford.edu/documents/NCSS%202013%20Final%20Draft.pdf">StanfordReport</a> (page 44) &quot;When compared to the 2009
results, the 2013 findings indicate overall improvement in learning
gains for students at charter schools relative to their traditional
public school peers in both reading and math. These positive
findings are driven largely by performance changes in the continuing
charter schools, i.e., those that were included in both the 2009 and
2013 studies. About eight percent of those schools closed during the
current time period, and an analysis of their impacts indicates that
these were severely underperforming schools in both subjects.&quot;</li>
<li>Since charter schools are compared directly against their
competitors, and closed if they are underperforming, schools with an
established reputation are at a similar level to public schools.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<ul>
<li>Public schools should be funded by the Federal Government.
<ul>
<li>Charter schools perform at least as well as Public schools with
reference to metrics such as reading and math performance.</li>
<li>Having public schools give parents and students more choice, and
allow them to &quot;vote with their feet&quot;</li>
<li>There is some evidence that just having charter schools around
improves the quality of district schools.</li>
<li>Charter school funding must come from somewhere. The best place
would be from that of public schools, since they complement their
functions.</li>
</ul>
