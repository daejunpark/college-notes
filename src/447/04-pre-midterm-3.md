Connected spaces
: A Metric/Topological space is connected if, for all $U, V \subseteq S$ such that
  * $U, V$ are open
  * $X= U \cup V$
  * $U\cap V \ne \phi$
  implies $U = \phi$ or $V = \phi$

Path Connected
: ... if forall $x, y \ion S, \exists f:[a, b] \to S$ continuous, so that $f(a) = x, f(b) = y$

Differentiablilty
: $

#### Theorem N24.1: Continuous functions  map connected sets to connected sets.

#### Theorem 22.5: A path connected space is connected

Note: Converse is NOT true
XXX: "Deleted broom" is an example of connected space that is not path connected.
