\newcommand \ch {\text{ch}}
\newcommand \minimal  [2] { m_{#1,#2}(x) }

Characteristic of a field (or Integral Domain in general) $F$ $\ch(F)$:
:   the smallest integer $i$, such that $i \cdot 1_F = 0$ if such an $i$
    exists otherwise $0$.

-   $\ch(F)$ must be prime or 0 (since there are no zero-divisors in a
    field)
-   If $\ch(F) = p$ then for all $\alpha \in p$, $p \alpha = 0$
-   $\Q, \R, \Z$ have Characteristic $0$.
-   $\F_p[x]$ and it's field of fractions have characteristic $p$

Prime subfield
:   is the field generated by $1_F$


  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Integral Domain           Characteristic      Prime Subfield
  ------------------------- ------------------- -------------------------
  $\Q$, $\R, \Z$            0                   $\Q$

  $\F_p$                    $p$                 $\F_p$

  $\F_{p^n}$                $p$                 $\F_p$

  Field of fractions of $R$ $\ch(R)$            Prime subfield of $R$
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

The prime subfield is either $\Q$ or $\F_p$ upto isomorphism.

$K / F$ "$K$ over $F$"
:   $F$ is a subfield of $K$

Degree of a field extension `[K : F]`
:   is the dimension of $K$ as a vector space over $F$

$F(\alpha, \beta, \ldots)$, field generated by $\alpha, \beta, \ldots \in K$
:   the smallest subfield of $K$ containing $\alpha, \beta, \ldots$

    - $F(\alpha)$ is said to be a simple extension, and $\alpha$ is called the 
      primitive element for the extension.

$\alpha \in K$ is algebraic over $F$
:   if $\alpha$ is the root of a nonzero polynnomial $p(x) \in F[x]$

Minimal polynomial $\minimal \alpha F$
:   is the unique irreducible monic polynnomial $\in F[x]$ that has
    $\alpha$ as a root.

Splitting Field
:   $K / F$ is a splitting field for a polynomial $p(x) \in F[a]$ iff -
    factors completely into linear factors in $K[x]$ - does not factor
    into linear terms over any proper subfields of $K$ containing $F$

Normal Extension
:   $K/F$ is the splitting field for a  collection of polynomials
    $\in F[x]$ (This is a subset of algebraic)
    
Separable $p(x)$
:   has no multiple roots in the splitting field

-   If $\alpha$ is a root for both $p(x)$ and $p'(x)$ its derivative,
    then $p(x)$ is not separable.

-   In any field $\F$
    -   product of distinct irreducible $\implies$ separable
    -   specifically, irreducible $\implies$ separable

Separable field $K$ over $F$
:   iff every element in $K$ is the root of a separable polynomial in $F$
:   iff every minimal polynomial over $F$ of elements in $K$ is separable

Perfect field $K$
:   all finite fields, characteristic $0$ fields
:   every irreducible polynnomial over $K$ is separable

In field of char 0:

- $(a + b) ^ p  = a^p + b^p$
- $(ab)^p = a^p b^p$
- $\F = \F^p$

Primitive $n$th root of unity $\zeta_n$
:   An $n$th root of that generates the other $n$th roots

Cyclotomic Field of the $n$th roots of unity   
:   $\Q(\zeta_n)$
    
    $[\Q(\zeta_n) : \Q] = \phi(n)$ where $\phi$ is the euler phi function
    
    For $n = p, \phi(n) = p - 1$

Let $F$ be a field and $p(x) \in F[x]$ irreducible of degree $n$, then:

-   $F[x]/(p(x)) \iso F(\alpha)$ is the extension of $F$ containing a
    root of $p(x)$ where $\alpha$ is a root of $p(x)$.

    It's degree is $\deg {p(x)}$ and $1, \alpha, \alpha^2, \ldots, \alpha^{n-1}$ is it's basis.

    $p(x)$ is the minimal polynomial for $\alpha$.

-   The degree of a splitting field of $p(x)$ is atmost $\deg p(x)$

---

-   Any field homomorphism is either $0$ or injective (i.e. $h(F) = 0$
    or $f(F) \iso F$).
    -   (follows from: "The only ideals of a field are $0$ and $F$")

1.  There is a field with an isomorphic copy of $F$, in which $p(x)$
    irreducible has a root.
    -   (one such field is $K = F[x] / (p(x))$, since $p(x)$ is
        irreducible)
2.  Let $\theta = x \pmod {(p(x))}$. Then:
    $W = 1, \theta, \theta^2, \ldots, \theta^n$ forms a basis.

    -   ($F[x]$ in an ED $\implies$ max degree in $F[x] / (p(x))$ is $n$
        $\implies W$ spans $K$)
    -   ($W$ not linear independent $\implies$ $p(x)$ divides
        polynnomial with lesser degree. Contradiction)
    -   Note that $p(\theta) = 0$.
    -   Thus $K$ is a degree $n$ extension over $F$

3.  Suppose $K$ is any field containing $\alpha$, a root of $p(a)$, then
    $F[x]/(p(x)) \iso F(\alpha)$

    -   (The natural homomorphism
        $\phi : F[x] \to F(\alpha), a(x) \mapsto a(\alpha)$ is an
        isomorphism)

    **From `1.` and `3.` it follows that $f(\alpha)$ is the smallest
    field containing the root of an irreducible polynomial.**

4.  The minimal polynomial $\minimal \alpha F$ is unique

5.  If $L/F$ is an extension, and $\alpha$ is algebraic over $F$ and $L$
    then $\minimal \alpha F$ divides $\minimal \alpha F$

6.  Let $\alpha$ be algebraic over $F$, then
    $F(\alpha) \iso F[x] / (\minimal \alpha F)$. - The
    $[F(\alpha) : F ] = \deg \minimal m \alpha F = \deg \alpha$

7.  A polynomial $p(x)$ has $\alpha$ as a root iff $m_{\alpha,F}(x)$ divides
    $p(x)$
