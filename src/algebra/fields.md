\newcommand \ch {\text{ch}}
\newcommand \minimal  [2] { m_{#1,#2}(x) }

Characteristic of a field (or Integral Domain in general) $F$ $\ch(F)$:
:   the smallest integer $i$, such that $i \cdot 1_F = 0$ if such an $i$
    exists otherwise $0$.

-   $\ch(F)$ must be prime or 0 (since there are no zero-divisors in a
    field)
-   If $\ch(F) = p$ then for all $\alpha \in p$, $p \alpha = 0$
-   $\Q, \R, \Z$ have Characteristic $0$.
-   $\F_p[x]$ and it's field of fractions have characteristic $p$

Prime subfield
:   is the field generated by $1_F$


  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Integral Domain           Characteristic      Prime Subfield
  ------------------------- ------------------- -------------------------
  $\Q$, $\R, \Z$            0                   $\Q$

  $\F_p$                    $p$                 $\F_p$

  $\F_{p^n}$                $p$                 $\F_p$

  Field of fractions of $R$ $\ch(R)$            Prime subfield of $R$
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

The prime subfield is either $\Q$ or $\F_p$ upto isomorphism.

$K / F$ "$K$ over $F$"
:   $F$ is a subfield of $K$

Degree of a field extension `[K : F]`
:   is the dimension of $K$ as a vector space over $F$

$F(\alpha, \beta, \ldots)$, field generated by $\alpha, \beta, \ldots \in K$
:   the smallest subfield of $K$ containing $\alpha, \beta, \ldots$

$\alpha \in K$ is algebraic over $F$
:   if $\alpha$ is the root of a nonzero polynnomial $p(x) \in F[x]$

Minimal polynomial $\minimal \alpha F$
:   is the unique irreducible monic polynnomial $\in F[x]$ that has $\alpha$
    as a root.

Constructing the algebraic closure of a field
---------------------------------------------


-   Any field homomorphism is either $0$ or injective (i.e. $h(F) = 0$
    or $f(F) \iso F$).
    -   (follows from: "The only ideals of a field are $0$ and $F$")

Let $F$ be a field and $p(x) \in F[x]$ irreducible of degree $n$, then:

-   There is a field with an isomorphic copy of $F$, in which
    $p(x)$ has a root.
    -   (one such field is $K = F[x] / (p(x))$)
-   Let $\theta = x \pmod {(p(x))}$. Then:
    $W = 1, \theta, \theta^2, \ldots, \theta^n$ forms a basis.
    -   ($F[x]$ in an ED $\implies$ max degree in $F[x] / (p(x))$ is $n$
        $\implies W$ spans $K$)
    -   ($W$ not linear independent $\implies$ $p(x)$ divides
        polynnomial with lesser degree. Contradiction)
    - Note that $p(\theta) = 0$.
    - Thus $K$ is a degree $n$  extension over $F$

-   Suppose $K$ is any field containing $\alpha$, a root of $p(a)$, then
    $F[x]/(p(x)) \iso F[\alpha]$
    -   (The natural homomorphism
        $\phi : F[x] \to F(\alpha), a(x) \mapsto a(\alpha)$ is an
        isomorphism)

-   The minimal polynomial $\minimal \alpha F$ is unique

-   If $L/F$ is an extension, and $\alpha$ is algebraic over $F$ and $L$
    then $\minimal \alpha F$ divides $\minimal \alpha F$

-   Let $\alpha$ be algebraic over $F$, then
    $F(\alpha) \iso F[x] / (\minimal \alpha F)$. 
    - The $[F(\alpha) : F ]  = \deg \minimal m \alpha F = \deg \alpha$
