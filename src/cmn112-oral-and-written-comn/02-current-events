Although Uber is one of the 93 companies supporting this, public opinion has forced it's CEO, Travis Kalanick, out of his position on Trump's Strategic and Policy Forum.

Twitter users are calling for Uber users to uninstall the app under the DeleteUber hash tag and protestors are campaigning for his resignation from Trump's forum.

Trump's executive order has affected 1000s of Uber drivers and the CEO had been hoping to raise his concerns to the president at the forum's first meeting on the 3rd (Feb).

However, the protestors treated his presence on the forum as a sign of his support for Trumps agenda. Kalanick retorted that this sign had been misinterpreted -- his agenda at the forum was to steer Trump away from this policy. He says he joined out of the "belief that by speaking up and engaging, we can make a difference".

He backs up his motivation, condemning the ban and contributing to relief groups and even promising that the company will compensate the drivers stuck overseas and will create a $3 million legal defence fund.

Protesters are also annoyed at Uber for continuing to serve customers at JFK during a taxi strike in protest of the executive order. They claimed that Uber was trying to break the strike by disabling surge pricing at JFK.

While we could argue that this is a victory for Trump protesters, one wonders whether closing down channels of communication with Trump is the best move in the long term.
