* - all had moment, stumble, seize, panic, haven't you?
  - In the speech Hadfield talks about this -- dealing with fear.

* Context
  - evo, fear is great, savannah, lion, fight or flight, keeps you alive.
  - outlived usefulness
  - Buzz Aldrin, second, piloting lunar lander
    **"A mind concerned about danger is a clouded mind. It's paralyzing."**
  - don't have time when: piloting lunar lander; interview/speech, finals
* Structure
  - In Ted Talk, Chris Hadfield, Canadian Astro, talks deal with fear.
  - **appropriate**, two space shuttle missions, commander of ISS
  - structured as **analogy**, parallels between his, our own
  - why? what we'd get out of it. 
* First Argument: Analogy
  - dangerous situations he's been in -- more dangerous
    and "scary" than most of us will see in our lifetimes.
      - shuttle flight ~ 1 in 40, catastrophic failure;
      - out in space suit, thin fabric, going blind;
      - Soyuz capsule, hurtling, atmosphere, essentially meteorite.
  - * walks us through each of situations, gory detail, **through his eyes.**
    * our fears, **"Maybe spiders?"** comical contrast
  - * **analogy extreme**, effective because of that. 
     * you think to yourself, his big fears, my little ones?
  - Why it's convincing?
     * book **"An astronaut's guide to Life on Earth"**, "Wo**r**king the problem" - a NASA term
     * practicing, mind or real, until overridden natural instincts
     * He walks us, rationalizing it: aren't poisonous, bright markings, sting
     * thought through it, not difficult.... building up confidence and breaking down fear. 
* Second Argument: Motivation
   - second argument, motivation
  -  **"Why would you take these kind of risks?".**
     * dreams of nine year old you;  complete PhD, cutting edge
   - dauntingly scary, far off: but overcoming 
   - powerful motive, right?
* Conclusion
  - Hadfield does great job.
  - suspense and tension, then relieving comedy, audience engaged.
  - Even though talking about crazy situations things not intimidating, but instead
    friendly and caring
  - arguments solid, leaves you wondering about your puny fears, really
    motivates you
