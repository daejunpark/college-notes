I'm sure you've all had that moment, say during your public speech assignment in
class, where you stumble, seize up and panic. Well, in the speech I'm analyzing
Chris Hadfield talks about exactly this -- dealing with fear.

From an evolutionary standpoint, fear is great when you're living in the
savannah and you see a lion -- it really makes your fight or flight instinct
kick in and keeps you alive. But you could argue it's outlived some of it's
usefulness. Buzz Aldrin, the second man on the moon, speaks of piloting of the
lunar lander "A mind concerned about danger is a clouded mind. It's paralyzing."
You don't have time to think about the fear when you're piloting the lunar
lander, or even when you're in the middle of an interview or speech, Or a day
before your finals when you realize you won't be able to get through the
syllabus, do you?

In his Ted Talk, Chris Hadfield talks to us about how he's learned to deal with
fear. His whole speech is structured as an analogy, drawing parallels between
how he faces his fears through training and rational thought, and how we can
each deal with our own. He talks about why we would want to deal with them, what
we'd get out of it. Hadfield is a very appropriate person to talk about this --
He's a Canadian astronaut who's flown two space shuttle missions and served as
commander of the International Space Station.

He's tells us of the dangerous situations he's been in -- more dangerous and
"scary" than most of us will see in our lifetimes. A shuttle flight to the ISS
had an ~ 1 in 40 chance of having a catastrophic failure; being out in a space
suit, with just a thin layer of fabric between you and the deadly vacuum of
space, and going blind; and of coming back to earth in the Soyuz capsule
hurtling through the atmosphere, essentially a meteorite. He tells us how his
training taught him to deal with these fears. He walks us through each of these
situations in enough gory detail for you to see through his eyes.

He then asks us about our fears -- "Maybe spiders?" he said in an almost comical
contrast to what he'd been talking about earlier. The analogy is really extreme,
but is really effective perhaps even because of that, you think to yourself if
he can get over his fears, of these crazy dangerous situations, then why can't I
get over my little ones?

He walks us through rationalizing this --  most spiders aren't poisonous, the
ones that are have bright marking letting you know, and even then most can't
harm a human beyond a painful sting. Once you've thought through it, it's not
difficult to bring yourself to walk through one spider web, then another,
building up your confidence and breaking down your fear.

In his book "An astronaut's guide to Life on Earth", Hadfield call this approach
"Working the problem" - a NASA term for working through your available options,
of trees of decisions and their possible consequences until you find a solution
that works. He talks about practicing dealing with a situation until you've
overridden your natural instincts.

His second argument to get over our fears --  one of motivation -- is that once
we get over these fears a whole new world of opportunities opens up. He asks
"Why would you take these kind of risks?". Because you can get
on that space shuttle and the dreams of nine year old you come true. You could
become a doctor, or complete your PhD and be on the cutting edge of research in
your field. These dream seem dauntingly scary and far off, but by overcoming
your fears, you can get there. It's a pretty powerful motive if you ask me.

Hadfield does a great job. Building up suspense and tension and then relieving
it with a bit of comedy, all the while keeping the audience engaged. His arguments
are solid and he leaves you wondering what your puny fears are about. He
motivates and tells you how to go about beating your own fears.
