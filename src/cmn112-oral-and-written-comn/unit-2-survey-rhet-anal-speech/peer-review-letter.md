Jaelyn,

I think that your draft looks great! You've got a good attention getter and seem
to know how you are going to argue for the proposition. You've drawn useful
insights from the survey and have incorporated them into the content well You've
given a clear outline of what you plan to do and how you implement it.

I think that you focus too much on income tax and it's relation to the economy.
The purpose for implementing this tax is not to salvage the income tax that the
government loses from not having people work, but to slow down the loss of jobs
by discouraging automation.

Another thing that may be worth looking into is alternates (like subsidising the
wages of workers) to the robot tax and why implementing the robot tax is better
than those alternatives. My main argument against the robot tax is that there
are alternate solutions that would not penalize innovation as much, so it may be
a good idea to include something about that in your speech.

It seems like a bit of a balancing act to use the emotional aspect of job loss
as your main argument without resorting to fallacies, but you seem to be aware
of this issue and have ideas on how to handle it.

The paper you've written suggests that you've got your thoughts well organized
and know what you want to do. The content looks well-researched and thoughtful.
I look forward to listening to your speech!
