## Introduction

### History & Cause of the Question

Albert Shanker, president of the Americal Federation of Teachers
introduced the idea of charter schools in 1988. Inspired by a visit to
a public school in Cologne, Germany, he argued that allowing schools
independence -- having teachers make decisions democratically -- would
improve the quality of education provided to students.
[What are charter schools]

Charter schools were implemented in the US in the 1990s and since then
there has been considerable debate as to whether or not they should
be funded by the government.

###  Definitions and terms

Charter School
: A charter school is an independently run public school granted
greater flexibility in its operations, in return for greater
accountability for performance. The "charter" establishing each school
is a performance contract detailing the school's mission, program,
students served, performance goals, and methods of assessment.

Traditional Public Schools (TPS) / District Schools
: Tradional Public Schools or District Schools are schools funded by
  the government, and governed by school the district.

  Strictly speaking charter schools are public schools, but this brief
  uses the terms "Traditional public school", "district school" and
  "public school" interchangeably. The term "charter school" shall be
  used explicitly otherwise.

### Main Issues of the debate

* Should the government continue to invest in charter schools.
* Do charter schools do as well as traditional public schools.

## Affirmative Case Arguments

0. Introduction: We won't argue that Charter Schools are better than
   public schools, but instead that they at least are as good as public
   schools, and having charter schools introduce more competition and
   in turn make the whole school system better .


1. Offer more choice to students and parents.

   *  A child's early education is something that stays with them
      their entire lifetime. It effects their ability to learn and
      to think and has huge downstream effects -- the university they
      get into, their career.

   *  According to [edchoice], "Families who can afford it often
      choose their neighborhood public schools by moving to a
      residence within their desired school’s assigned district."

   *  While this is a great option for wealthier students, its not
      possible for lower-income students. "Families do not need to use
      ESAs, vouchers or tax-credit scholarships to pay to enroll their
      children in charter schools as these schools are already
      publicly funded."

   * According to [ed.gov], unless a public school "has been
     identified by the state for school improvement, corrective
     action, or restructuring", their children are not eligible to
     choose a school in another district.
   
   * This means poorer students do not have a choice of school unless
     the district schools are in bad enough condition that they do not
     meet the government set standards.

2. Otherwise disadvantaged students do better

   * According to the Stanford Report (page 82), "Charter schools and
     their feeder schools are educating more disadvantaged students
     than in 2009. Across the 27 states in this study, more than half
     of the charter students live in poverty as indicated by their
     eligibility for free and reduced price lunch programs (54
     percent), a greater share than the US as a whole and an increase
     for charter schools from 2009. Since 2009, the proportion of
     Hispanic students in charters has begun to approach the
     proportion of black students. Compared to their feeders, charter
     schools enroll a lower percentage of white and Hispanic students
     and a higher percentage of black students. These shifts reflect
     growth in the proportion of disadvantaged parents that is aware,
     is informed and is comfortable exercising their options for
     school choice. The typical charter student arrives at a charter
     school with lower levels of educational performance than was the
     case in 2009."

##  Rebuttals

1. Argument: "Instead of defending public schools, to fund charter
   schools, we should just improve public schools. Funding Charter
   schools takes away money and resources from public schools. Instead
   we should fix public schools."

   * Charter schools are actual funded LESS than public schools.

   * According to a [UoAReport](University of Arkansas report), there
     is a funding gap of 28.4% between public schools and charter
     schools -- "the average public charter school student in the U.S.
     is receiving $3,814 less in funding than the average traditional
     public school student."

   * The evidence indicates that while Charter Schools do take money
     away from traditional public schools, they provide a similar
     level of education even while receiving considerably less
     funding.


2. Argument: "They are less diverse compared to public schools ..."

   * Charter schools are required to choose students by lottery.
     This would mean that the diversity of the charter schools merely
     reflects the diversity of the people applying to these schools,
     and not the admission standards of charter schools.

   * [StanfordReport](page 81) actually finds that students of ethnic
     background and poorer students actually do better in charter
     schools than in traditional public schools:

     "The biggest impacts are among Hispanic students who are English
     language learners; they gain 50 additional days of learning in
     reading and 43 additional days in math from charter attendance
     per year. Black students in poverty at charter schools gain 29
     additional days in reading and 36 additional days of learning in
     math. White charter students lose 14 days of learning in reading
     and have 50 fewer days learning in math."

     "Students in poverty, English language learners, and special
     education students all benefit from attending charter schools as
     well. Because these are students generally considered to be
     underserved by the TPS (Traditional Public School) system, higher
     quality educational options for these groups are of particular
     interest."

3. Argument: "Competition between schools doesn't improve them"

    * A study [US Department of Education Study], "Most districts
      implemented new educational programs, made changes in
      educational structures in district schools, and/or created new
      schools with programs that were similar to those in the local
      charter schools.".

      It goes on to say "districts with declining enrollment that did
      not grant the charter were more likely to perceive that charter
      schools had a negative affect on their budget and view charter
      schools as competition. These districts responded competitively,
      making a number of changes in district operations and
      introducing programs into the educational system designed to
      compete for students and parents."

   *  [EduNext](A 2016 report) by B. Gill a senior fellow at Mathematica Policy
      Research and his colleague, aggregating information from 11
      studies, each from different cities in different states finds
      "the literature provides some support for the “healthy
      competition” hypothesis and almost none for the hypothesis that
      students in district schools are harmed by the growth of
      charters. Six studies found some evidence of positive effects,
      four found no effects, and one found negative effects. Breaking
      the results out by locations, in six cases that encompass five
      cities and states, there is evidence that charter schools
      produce (small) positive effects on the achievement of students
      in nearby public schools. In nine other cases, encompassing
      eight cities and states and one nationwide sample, charter
      schools have been found to have no effect on students in nearby
      district schools, positive or negative. The literature has only
      a single case—involving a single school district—in which
      charter schools have been found to have negative effects on the
      achievement of students in nearby district schools."

   * This evidence shows that at the very least charted schools cause
     small improvements to the quality of education at public schools,
     and at the same time provide more choice to parents and students.
     
## Blocks

Response to: Students in charter schools don't do as well as those in
public schools.

 * [StanfordReport](page 78-79) says that "Students with one year
   of charter enrollment realize smaller learning gains than their
   peers in TPS in both reading and math, with the disadvantage
   equal to 43 and 58 fewer days of learning, respectively.
   Learning gains improve significantly for charter students by
   their second year of enrollment – seeing about 22 more days of
   learning in reading and 14 more days in math. Once a student is
   enrolled for four or more years, their learning gains outpace
   TPS by 50 days in reading and 43 days in math per year."

Response to: Charter Schools take funding away from public schools

1. 

  * While they do take funding away from public schools they 
    are more efficient that public schools receiving on average 30% 
    less funds per student than traditional public schools. At the
    same time they producing similar results to public schools (or
    in the case of disadvantaged students, better results).

  * This means that the money that would have been spent on public
    schools is better invested in charter schools.

2. Unfortunately we live in a world with limited resources, as per
   basic economic principals, we need to deal with "unlimited wants,
   and limited resources". The funding for charter schools needs to
   come from some where, and since they reduce the number of students
   that attend district schools, the best place for the funding to
   come from funds that would have otherwise been used to fund those
   students.

Response to: Charter schools are held to lower standards than public
schools.

* Charter schools are closed when underperforming with respect to
  alternatives. Public schools aren't.
* While on average new charter schools preform worse than
  alternatives, as the poorer ones are weeded out or improve, the
  average quality of charter schools improves.
* According to [StanfordReport] (page 44) "When compared to the 2009
  results, the 2013 findings indicate overall improvement in learning
  gains for students at charter schools relative to their traditional
  public school peers in both reading and math. These positive
  findings are driven largely by performance changes in the continuing
  charter schools, i.e., those that were included in both the 2009 and
  2013 studies. About eight percent of those schools closed during the
  current time period, and an analysis of their impacts indicates that
  these were severely underperforming schools in both subjects."
* Since charter schools are compared directly against their
  competitors, and closed if they are underperforming, schools with an
  established reputation are at a similar level to public schools.

##  Conclusion

* Public schools should be funded by the Federal Government.
  - Charter schools perform at least as well as Public schools with
    reference to metrics such as reading and math performance.
  - Having public schools give parents and students more choice, and
    allow them to "vote with their feet"
  - There is some evidence that just having charter schools around
    improves the quality of district schools.
  - Charter school funding must come from somewhere. The best place
    would be from that of public schools, since they complement their
    functions.
