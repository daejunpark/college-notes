## 1. Which team would you have voted for? Why?

I voted for the affirmative team, since I felt that they had more concrete
evidence for their stance for their stance. The negative team's evidence seemed
murkier, and they a sample of just one for bringing across the advantages of a
president who took advantage of momentum gained from the initial primaries to
win the presidency. The affirmative team effectively countered the opposing
teams idea that the new coverage was a benefit (because it better informed the
public about the candidates), with it's counter about that the news merely
"horse race" type coverage, and not so enlightening.

## 2. What was the most important or persuasive argument for the affirmative team?

The most persuasive argument, is that people in states who's primaries are
toward the beginning of the election season have an unfair advantage. The
votes of people from these states count for more than the votes of people
from other states, giving them an unfair representation. This goes against
the basic principle of universal suffrage (One person, one vote), and can
the affirmative's team argument gets this point across well.

## 3. What was the most important or persuasive argument for the negative team?

I felt that the most persuasive argument that the negative team put across
was that the news coverage during the primaries helps educate the general public
about the candidates, that it gives the media time to investigate the
candidates,  and inform the public about their past performance, and personal
ideals. This point was somewhat undermined by the fact the both presidential
candidates for the 2016 elections were extremely unpopular.

## 4. Are there any major similarities or differences with your decision and theirs?

The Judges seemed to be leaning towards the negative side. The point that
being in a rush to chose someone as important as the president of a country
may not be a good idea and so streamlining is not so important. The judges
agreed that the affirmative's most compelling argument was that initial states
have an unfair amount of representation.
