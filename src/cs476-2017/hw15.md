1.  a.  > (10.4 in lecture 10) Let $h: \A \to \B$ be a surjective
        $\Sigma$-homomorphism, $u=v$ a $\Sigma$ equation. Show that
        $$\A \satisfies u = v \implies \B \satisfies u = v$$

        Since $h$ is surjective, there exists $g$ such that
        $g; h = id_B$. Let $b \in [X \to B]$. Then,
        $b; g \in [X \to A]$. But since $\A \satisfies u = v$,
        $u (b;g)_\A = v (b;g)_\A$. But then, applying $h$ to these
        elements, we get
        $u (b;g;h)_\A = v (b;g;h)_\A \implies u b_\B = v b_\B$. Thus
        $\forall b \in [X \to B], u b = v b$, i.e. $\B \satisfies u = v$

    b.  Let $\Sigma = (0, 1, +)$, $\A := (\N, \__\N)$,
        $B = (\Z/2\Z, \__{\Z/2\Z})$ and
        $h: 2n \mapsto 0; 2n + 1 \mapsto 1$

        Then, $\B \satisfies 0 = 1 + 1$ but $\A \nsatisfies 0 = 1 + 1$

\newcommand \enabled {\text{enabled}}
\newcommand \taken   {\text{taken}}
\newcommand \fair    {\text{fair}}

2.  We are asked for the relation between the properties:

    a.  $\fair.l := (\henceforth\eventually \enabled .l) \limplies (\henceforth\eventually\taken.l)$
    b.  $\enabled.l \leadsto \taken.l := \henceforth(\enabled.l \limplies \eventually\taken.l)$
    c.  $\enabled.l \limplies \eventually\taken.l$

    Let the Kripke structure $\A$ model the rewrite system. Let
    $\pi = \enabled.l, \emptyset, \emptyset, \ldots$ be a trace.
    $\A, \pi\satisfies_{LTL} (\always\eventually\enabled.l) \limplies (\always\eventually\enabled.l)$
    but $\A, \pi\nsatisfies_{LTL} \enabled.l \leadsto \taken.l$ and
    $\A, \pi\nsatisfies_{LTL} \enabled.l \limplies \eventually\taken.l$
    So: $(a) \nimplies (b)$ and $(a) \nimplies (c)$.

    Let $\pi := \emptyset, \enabled.l, \emptyset,\emptyset, \ldots$.
    Then $\A, \pi\satisfies\enabled.l \limplies \eventually\taken.l$ and
    $\A, \pi \nsatisfies \enabled.l \leadsto \taken.l$
    So: $(c) \nimplies (b)$
    
    Let $\pi$ be a trace, and $\A, \pi \satisfy \enabled.l \leadsto \taken.l$.
    Then $\forall n\in\N, \A, \pi;s^n \satisfies \enabled.l \limplies \eventually \taken.l$.
    So, if $n = 0$, $\A,\pi \satisfies\enabled.l \limplies \eventually \taken.l$
    Thus, $(b) \implies (c)$
    
    Let $\pi := \enabled.l, \taken.l, \enabled.l, \enabled.l, \ldots$.
    Then, $(c) \A, \pi \satisfies \enabled.l   \limplies \eventually\taken.l$
    but not $(a): \A, \pi\nsatisfies (\always\eventually\enabled.l)\limplies(\always\eventually\taken.l)$.
    so, $(c) \nimplies (a)$.
    
    Let $\pi$ be a trace such that $(b): \always(\enabled.l \limplies \eventually\taken.l)$ holds.
    i.e. for every state in which $\enabled.l$, there is a later state such that $\taken.l$.
    For $(a): (\always\eventually \enabled.l) \limplies (\always\eventually\taken.l)$ to
    be false, the antecedent $(\always\eventually \enabled.l)$ must hold: There must 
    be infinitly many $\enabled.l$ states. Since $(b)$ holds, each of those states
    must have a $\taken.l$ state after it. i.e. there must be inifinitly many
    $\taken.l$ states -- $(a)$ holds and $(b) \implies (a)$.
    
    Thus:
    
    i.  None of the formulae are semantically equivalent.
    ii. They are all different.
    iii. $(b) \implies (a)$ and $(b) \implies (c)$ but no other implications
         hold.
    iv. Yes. $(a)$ and $(c)$ are independent.
    
3.  ```{pipe='cat > din-phil-check.maude'}
    load hw15/dinphil.maude
    mod NJR-DINPHIL-CHECK is
        inc DINPHIL .
        inc (MODEL-CHECKER) *
              ( sort Nat to Nat*, sort NzNat to NzNat*
              , op _+_ to _.+_, op _*_ to _.*_
              , op _<_to _.<_, op _<=_ to _.<=_) .
        subsort ThreadedImpState < State .

        vars MEM : Memory .
        vars PGM1 PGM2 : Stmt   .
        vars TS : ThreadSet .
        vars N M O P : Nat    . 
        vars S   : Stmt   .
        vars ST  : State .
        vars I J : Id     .
    ```

    After defining the needed variables, we define `two-eat`:
    ```{pipe='tee -a din-phil-check.maude'}
        op two-eat : -> Prop .
        eq    ( { eat ; PGM1 | N } { eat ; PGM2 | M } TS | MEM | P )
           |= two-eat = true .
        eq ST |= two-eat = false [owise] .
    ``` 
    
    and `neighbours-eat(N)`:
    
    ```{pipe='tee -a din-phil-check.maude'}
        op neighbours-eat(_) : Nat -> Prop .
        eq ( { eat ; PGM1 | 0 } { eat ; PGM2 | N     } TS | MEM | P ) |= neighbours-eat(N) = true .
        eq ( { eat ; PGM1 | M } { eat ; PGM2 | M + 1 } TS | MEM | P ) |= neighbours-eat(N) = true .
        eq ST |= neighbours-eat(N) = false [owise] .
    ```
    ```{pipe='cat >> din-phil-check.maude'}
    
    endm
    ```

    **Can two philosophers eat at the same time?** We'd expect that this hold in the case of four philosophers, and it does:
    ```{pipe='maude-test din-phil-check.maude'}
    search [1] (init-thds(1 + 1) | init-mem | 0) =>* ST:State such that ST:State |= two-eat .
    ```
    
    But suprisingly, it holds when there are two and three philosophers too!
    ```{pipe='maude-test din-phil-check.maude'}
    search [1] (init-thds(0    ) | init-mem | 0) =>* ST:State such that ST:State |= two-eat .
    ```

    ```{pipe='maude-test din-phil-check.maude'}
    search [1] (init-thds(1    ) | init-mem | 0) =>* ST:State such that ST:State |= two-eat .
    ```

    **Can two neighbors eat at the same time?** Since mutual exclusion seems to be broken, we'd expect them to. These are clearly some
    very rude philosophers!

    ```{pipe='maude-test din-phil-check.maude'}
    search [1] (init-thds(0    ) | init-mem | 0) =>* ST:State such that ST:State |= neighbours-eat(1) .
    ```

    ```{pipe='maude-test din-phil-check.maude'}
    search [1] (init-thds(1    ) | init-mem | 0) =>* ST:State such that ST:State |= neighbours-eat(2) .
    ```

    ```{pipe='maude-test din-phil-check.maude'}
    search [1] (init-thds(1 + 1) | init-mem | 0) =>* ST:State such that ST:State |= neighbours-eat(3) .
    ```

    **Why is this possible?** There is a race between the $N$th philosopher
    updating the variable, and the $N + 1$th checking it. Since the check and update of the variable is
    not atomic, the neighbours each execute the check of a particular
    variable before being scheduled for executing the update. Thus both checks
    succeed, and both are able to pick up the chopsticks.

4.  After creating the property file:
    ^[Note, that I am not confident that the `stagesstopped` and `isfirststage` atoms
    refer to the same stage in `Stage@stop` and `Stage@id` ]

    ```
    atom listenerstopped: Connector@stop == 0
    atom stagesstopped:   Stage@stop == 0
    atom isfirststage:    Stage@id   == 1
    formula: [] (stagesstopped -> <> listenerstopped)
    ```
    
    Running: `javarl.JavaRL -cls .../hw15/pipeline.java -mc pipeline.prop`
    gives us:
    
    ```
    -cls../src/cs476-2017/hw15/pipeline.java-mcpipeline.prop
    Start to reformat Java files...
       Reformating file /home/njr/co/github.com/nishantjr/college-notes/javarltut/../src/cs476-2017/hw15/pipeline.java . . .

    Start to execute Maude to interpret the program...
    End executing Maude.
    5180ms used. Result:
    The property has been verified!
    ``` 
    
    This succeeds even when the call to `stop()` in `main` is removed, so
    I know it is not just checking\
    `<> listenerstopped`.
