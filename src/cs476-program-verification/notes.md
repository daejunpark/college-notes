 * Dedeking cuts
 * Which bits are 1st order logic and which are set theory
   - Logical inference systems

A First order logic _theory_ provides:
- Language: $x \in y$, $x = y$, $(\exists x) \phi$ ....
    
- Axioms: List of formulae that are assumed true

Relative consistency axioms


first order logic's inference rules 

Zermelo Fraenkel set theory (with choice)

1. Null set exists: $\exists x: \forall y, y \notin x$

   The null set exists

2. Extensibility: $(\forall X, Y)((\forall e)e \in X \Leftrightarrow e \in Y) \Longrightarrow X = Y$

   Definition of equality

3. ~~Comprehension: For any $\phi$ in the language of set theory $\mathcal L$, $(\exists! X)(\forall e \in X \Longleftrightarrow \phi)$~~

   Fails because the set of all non-circular sets is a paradox.

.

3. Separation: For any $\phi$ in the language of set theory $\mathcal L$,
   $(\forall \mathcal U)(\exists! X)(\forall e \in X \Longleftrightarrow e \in \mathcal U ^ \phi)$



# Exercise 2

Assuming that the set N of natural numbers has been fully axiomatized
in set theory, and in particular that all the natural numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, etc.,
and the multiplication operation2 Â· on natural numbers have been axiomatized in
this way, write a formula that, using the axiom of separation, can be used to
define the set of prime numbers as a subset of N.

$P = \{ x | \forall a, b \in \mathbb N; a, b \ne 1; x \ne a\cdot b; x \in \mathbb N \}$
