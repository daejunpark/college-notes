Production Possibility Frontier
: Curve representing possible combination of good that can be produced with a
  given set of resources.
   * Tends to be a convex curve since opportunity costs increase as we tend
     towards producing more of a single good.
     e.g. Dedicating more resources to studying ECON means you get "fed-up$ of
     ECON.
   * Can improve / "enlarge" PPF by increasing resource availabl (e.g.
     Technology, time, money).
   * Trade can improve production beyond the PPFs of BOTH parties
