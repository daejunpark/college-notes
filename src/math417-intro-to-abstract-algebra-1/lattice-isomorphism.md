Inverse image
: given $\varphi: G \to H, B \subseteq H$, $\varphi^{\-1}(B) = \{ g \in G: \varphi(g) \in B \}$ 

## Correspondance theorem / Lattice Isomorphism theorm

> Let $\varphi: G \to \bar G$ is an surjective homomorphism, with kernel $N$
> 1. $s: \{\text{subgroups of } \bar G\} \to \{\text{subgroups of G containing} N\}$  
>    $s(\bar B) = \varphi^{-1}(\bar B)$ is a bijection
> 2. Normal groups are mapped to normal groups.

1. For an subgroup $\bar B$ of $\bar G$,  $\varphi\{-1}(\bar B)$ is a subgourp of $G$  
   since $e \in \bar B$, $N = \varphi^{-1}(\{e\}) \subseteq \varphi^{-1}(\bar B)$
2. s.t: $s$ is bijective: $A \mapsto \varphi(A)$ is it's inverse: $\varphi(\varphi^{-1}(\bar B)) \le \bar G$ and is in $\bar B$.
   Since $\varphi$ is surjective
