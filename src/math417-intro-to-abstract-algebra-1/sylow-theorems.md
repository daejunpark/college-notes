Subgroups of finite groups

$$\begin{aligned}
|G| = p   && G &\cong \mathbb Z_p \\
|G| = p^2 &&     G &\cong \mathbb Z_{p^2} \text{ or } \mathbb Z _p \times \mathbb Z _p \\
\text{ finite generated, abelian} && G &\cong \mathbb Z ^ n \times\quad \mathbb Z_{p_1} \times\mathbb Z_{p_2} \times \cdots\times\mathbb Z_{p_n} \\
\end{aligned}$$

#### Theorem 5.4.6: Cauchy's theorem
> $p$ divides $|G|$. $G$ has an element of order $P$

#### Theorem 5.4.7: First Sylow theorem:
> $p^n$ divides $|G|$, then $G$ has a subgroup of order $p^n$

$p$-sylow
: If $p^n$ is the highest power dividing $|G|$, then a subgroup of order  $p^n$
is $p$-sylow.

#### Theorem 5.4.9:
> $G$ is finite. $H$ is a subgroup of order $p^s$, $P$ is $p$-sylow of $G$.   
> Then $\exists a \in G; aHa ^{-1} \subseteq P$

#### Theorem 5.4.10: $2^{nd}$ Sylow: "co-$p$-sylow" subgroups are conjugate
> $P, Q$ are $p$-Sylow of $G$. Then $P, Q$ are conjugate.

#### Theorem 5.4.11: $3^{rd}$ Sylow: Number of $p$-sylow subgroups divides $|G|$, $= 1 \text{ mod } p$
