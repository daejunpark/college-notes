Galois Group
: The automorphism group of a field extension is Galois iff
  $|\mathrm{Aut}(K/F)| = [ K : F ]$

Characteristic of field $F$
: Let $G$ be the group generated by $\mathbb 1_F$. Then the characteristic of $F$ is
  $|G|$ if it is finite. Otherwise it is $0$.

  Characteristic is $0$ or prime

Prime subfield
: Subfield generated by $\mathbb 1_F$, $\mathbb Q$ or $\mathbb F_p$

  $\mathbb Q, \mathbb C$ and $\mathbb R$ have prime subfield $\mathbb Q$

Simple field extension
: Generated by a single element


Minimal polynomial of $\alpha$ in $F$ ($M_{\alpha,F}(x)$)
: Unique monic irreducible polynomial for which $\alpha$ is a root

Algebraic Extension

---

Degree (index) of a field extension $[K / F]$
: It is the size of the basis of $K$ as a vector space of $F$

  * $\mathbb Q[i] / \mathbb Q$ has degree 1
  * $\mathbb R / \mathbb Q$ has infinite degree

Compute ... as a product of cyclic $\mathbb Z$ modules:

* $\mathrm{Hom}(\mathbb Z / m \mathbb Z, \mathbb Z / n \mathbb Z) \cong \mathbb Z
/ (m,n) \mathbb Z$

Example:

 * Finite extension of $\mathbb Q$ whose Galois g is cyclic
  
   $\mathbb Q[i]$ has gg that fixes $\mathbb Q$. That leaves only $i$ that can
   take different values (and it's multiples... but those depend on $i$.)

   That gives us two possible homos: $i\mapsto i$ and $i\mapsto -i$

   Galois group is $\mathbb Z/2 \mathbb Z$
