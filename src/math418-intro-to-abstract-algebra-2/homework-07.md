Suppose automorphism $\sigma_1$  and $\sigma_2$ are two automorphisms of $K$,
that fix $F$ and take $\{\alpha _i\}$ to the same values.

Since $K$ is generated from $F$ by $\{\alpha _i\}$, any $x \in K$ can be expressed as 
$\sum_{i\le n} a_i \alpha_1^{p_1} \cdot \alpha_2^{b_2} \cdots \alpha_i^{b_i}$ 

$$\begin{aligned}
\sigma_1(x) &=
\sigma_1(\sum_{i\le n} a_i \alpha_1^{p_1} \cdot \alpha_2^{b_2} \cdots \alpha_i^{b_i}) \\
&= \sum_{i\le n} a_i \sigma_1(\alpha_1^{p_1}) \cdot \sigma_1(\alpha_2^{b_2}) \cdots \sigma_1(\alpha_i^{b_i}) \\
&= \sum_{i\le n} a_i \sigma_2(\alpha_1^{p_1}) \cdot \sigma_2(\alpha_2^{b_2}) \cdots \sigma_2(\alpha_i^{b_i}) \\
&= \sigma_2(\sum_{i\le n} a_i \alpha_1^{p_1} \cdot \alpha_2^{b_2} \cdots \alpha_i^{b_i}) \\
&= \sigma_2(x)
\end{aligned}$$

So any automorphism (that fixes $F$) is uniquely determined by the values
it takes $\{\alpha _i\}$ to.

Since the set of generators are a subset of $K$ it is obvious that if $K$ is
fixed, the generators are fixed. If $\sigma$ fixes the generators (and $F$ is
fixed) then since the identity automorphism for $K$ exists and fixes the
generators, by the previous result $\sigma$ is the identity automorphism and
fixes $K$.

(b) 

($\Leftarrow$) Since $G$ is generated by $\sigma_1 \ldots \sigma_k$, any $\sigma
\in G$ can be written as some composition of the generators. Since the
generators fix $E$, the composition must also fix $E$.

($\Rightarrow$) Since $G$ fixes $E$ and the generators of $G$ are a subset of
$G$, the generators must also fix $E$.

$\tau(a + ib) = a - ib$

Let $a + ib, c + id \in \mathbb C$. Then


$$\begin{aligned}
\tau( (a + ib) + (c+id)) &= \tau(a + c +i(b + d)) \\
&= a + c - i (b+d) \\
&=  a -ib  + c - id \\
&= \tau(a + ib) + \tau(c + id)\\
\end{aligned}$$

and

$$\begin{aligned}
\tau( (a + ib) (c+id))
&= \tau( ac + iad + ibc - db) \\
&= ac - iad -ibc - db \\
&= a(c - id) -ib(c - id) \\
&= (a -ib)(c - id) \\
&= \tau(a + ib)\tau(c + id)
\end{aligned}$$

So $\tau$ is a ring homomorphism.

Suppose $a + i b \in \text{ker}(\mathbb C) \Longrightarrow \tau(a + i b) = a -
ib = 0 \Longrightarrow a = 0, b = 0 \Longrightarrow \text{ker}(\mathbb C) =
\{0\}$. So $\tau$ must be bijective and so a automorphism.


## 14 #3

Suppose $\tau$ fixes $a + ib$, then $a + ib = a - ib \Longrightarrow b = -b
\Longrightarrow b + b = 0 \Longrightarrow b = 0$. Since $a \in \mathbb R$
this means that the fixed field of complex conjugation on $\mathbb C$ is
$\mathbb R$
