## Counting 

There are:
* $n!$ linear orderings of $n$ items.
* There are $(n-1)!$ orderings in a circle assuming orientation doesn't matter.
* $\dbinom n i$ subsets of size $i$  in a set of size $n$
* $\dbinom r { n_1, n_2, n_3, \cdots, n_r }  = \dfrac {n!} {n_1!n_2!n_3! \cdots n_r!}$
  ways to group $n$ items into $r$ distinct groups, where $\sum n_i = n$


Proof: Any natural number other than $1$ can be written as a product of prime
