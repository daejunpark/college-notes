* Expected value = $\sum_{\forall x} x \cdot p(x)$
* Indicator Random Variable: $I_E(x) = 1 if x \in E, = 0 if x \ni E$

### Prop 4.1

$X$ is a discrete Random Variable, and $p(x) = P(X=x)$,
q is a real valued function

$E[g(x)] = \suma g(x)p(x)$

In general $E[g(x)] \ne g(E[x])$ ?? Obvioushly? Different co-domains ne

ex: $g(x) = x^2$

P(X = -1) = 1/2
P(X =  1) = 1/2

1. Find the pmf of g(x) = X^2
   
   g(x) = x^2 can only take one value - "1"
   p_{x^2}(1) = 1

   P(x^2 = 1) = P(X = -1 \cup X = 1) = 0.5 + 0,5 = 1
   E[X^2] = \sum P_{E^2}(x)
          = 1

2. Use Prop 4.1:
   E(g(x)) = \sum g(x) p(x)
           = -1^2 * 1/2 + 1^2* 1/2
           = 1/2 + 1/2
           = 1

$g$ is linear (affine map) $g(x) = ax + b \Rightarrow E[g(x)] = g(E[x])$

i.e: $E[aX + b] = aE[x] + b$

$E[X]$ is the first moment
$E[X^2]$ is the second moment

$Variance(X) = E[(x - E[X])^2] = E[(x - mean)^2]
