$X = Binomial(n, p)$  
$P(X - k) = \dbinom n k p^k (1-p)^{n-k}$  


ex: Parents Genotypes are Gg
    4 children, what is probability that 3 have same phenotype

p(E_i) = \frac 3 4

$P(X = 3) = \dbinom 4 3 (\frac 3 4)^3 (\frac 1 4)^{4-3}$

## Voter power in a close presidential race.

State with population $n = 2k + q$ has $nc$ members in House of reperesentitives.

Close race iff remaining $2k$ votes will vote Repub/Demo with probability $=
\frac 1 2$

VD = Voter is decisive when the rest of the vote is exactly split.
X = Voters for democrats
$P(VD) = P(X = k) = \binom {2k} k \frac 1 {2^k} \frac 1 {2^k} $  
 $ =  \dfrac {(2k)!} {k!k!} \frac 1 {2^{2k}}$  
(by sterlings approx $k! \approx \frac {k^k \sqrt {2 \pi k} } {e^k }$)   
$ \approx \dfrac 1 {\sqrt { \pi k }} $

$$E[`Voter Power'] =
    (\text{Electoral Colleg Votes  if not decisicve}) * P(\text {not decicive})
    (\text{Electoral Colleg Votes  if decisicve}) * P(\text {decicive})
$$  
$ = 0 + \dfrac { nc } {\sqrt { \pi k }}$  
$ \propto \sqrt n$


Is pdf of binomial variable increasing of decreasing?

$\dfrac {p(x = k + 1)} {p(x = k)} \ge 1$?

$$ \frac{ \binom n { n -k -1} p ^ {k+1} (1-p) ^{n - k -1 } }
        { \binom n k p ^ k (1 -p) ^ { n -k } }

        $$
$ = \frac { ( n-k ) p } { (k + 1 ) (1 -p ) }$
