Lyapounov Exponents
: 

Upper Lyapounov Exponents in the direction of $v$
: $f: S \to S$, $\{x_0, f(x_0), \ldots, f^n(x_0), \ldots,  \}$,

  $L_v = \limsup_{n\to \infty} \frac 1 n \ln || D_f^n(x_0)v ||$  
  where $v$ is an vector in $\mathbb R^m$

  $\exists k \le m, l_1 < l_2 < \cdots < l_k$, and
  $\{0 \} \subseteq  F_1 \subset  F_2 \subset  \cdots \subset  F_n =  \mathbb R^m$

Accumulation points
: Points to which some subsequence converges

Brower theorem (general analog for fixed point theorem)
: $K \subseteq \mathbb R^m$, convex, compact and $f: K \to K$, continuous  
  then $\exists p \in K: f(p) = p$

Theorem
: $f: U \to \mathbb R^m, \quad U \subseteq \mathbb R^m$, open  
  Consider $\gamma$ a simple (no self-intersection), closed (loops), piecewise
  continuous $C^1$ curve, then $f(x) = x \forall x \in \gamma$
