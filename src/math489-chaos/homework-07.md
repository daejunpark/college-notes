## 5.4

State the transition graphs for the Markov partitions of the skinny baker map
and horseshoe map

### Skinny baker map

Here the Markov Partitions are $\{ L , R \}$, and itineraries are as shown

$$\begin{aligned}\\\\\\\\\\\\\end{aligned}$$

### Horseshoe

$$\begin{aligned}\\\\\\\\\\\\\end{aligned}$$


## 5.5: Show that the set of chaotic orbits of the horseshoe map is uncountable

The itineraries  of the horseshoe map are of the form $\cdots
S_{-3}S_{-2}S_{-1}\bullet S_1S_2\cdots S_i\cdots$, where $S_i$ is one of $L, R$.
These two sided itineraries correspond to exactly one point. The points are
periodic or asymptotically periodic iff the right hand side converges to some
repeated sequence. Since there are only countably many of these itineraries, and
uncountably many possible itineraries, there must be uncountably many chaotic
orbits.

## 5.9 

$$\begin{aligned}\\\\\\\\\\\\\end{aligned}$$

Consider the map $f$ on the boundary of $S$, and the vector $f(x) - x$. Since
the boundary of $f(S)$ "surrounds" that of $S$, and $f$ is continuous, $f(x) -
x$ must make at least one rotation. Then by theorem 5.10, there must be a fixed
point.
