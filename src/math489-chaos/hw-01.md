## Problem I

$f(x) = x - x^3$

For $x \in (0, \sqrt 2), 0 < f(x) = x(1 - x^2) < x(1 - 2) = x$. That is, after
each iteration, the value of $x$ decreases but stays in $(0, \sqrt 2)$. So the
orbits of $x$ must converge to $0$.

Similarly for $x \in (-\sqrt 2, 0), 0 > f(x) = x(1 - x^2) > x(1 - 2) = x$. That
is, after each iteration, the value of $x$ decreases but stays in $(0, \sqrt
2)$. So the orbits of $x$ must converge to $0$.

For $x > \sqrt 2, f(x) = x(1 - x^2) > x$. The value of $x$ keeps increasing and
diverges to infinity.

Orbits starting at $\pm \sqrt 2$ cycle between $\{\sqrt 2, - \sqrt 2\}$

## 1.1

When $a \ne 1$ fixed point for $l(x) = ax + b$ is $x = \dfrac {b} {1 - a}$ and $l'(x) = a$
So $l$ is attracting when $|a| < 1$ and repelling when $|a| > 1$. When $a = 1$
all points are fixed points, and none of them are attracting or repelling.

## 1.2 (a)

$f(0) = 0 - 0^2 = 0$ so $x = 0$ is a fixed point. $f'(0) = 1 - 2x |_{x=0} = 1$
so the test does not tell us if it's attracting or repelling. The orbit of $x =
0.1 = \{ 0.1, 0.099, 0.089 \}$. The orbit of $x = -0.01$ is $\{ -0.01, - 0.0101
\cdots \}$ So for negative values it is repelling. So $f$ is not stable, and
neither attracting nor repelling.

## 1.2(b)

$g(0) = tan(0) = 0$ so $x = 0$ is a fixed point. $g'(0) = \sec^2(0) = 1$ so the
test doesn't give us any information. The orbit of $x = 0.1$ is $\{0.1, 0.1003,
0.1006\}$ seems to be repulsive. The orbit of $x = -0.1$ is $\{0.1, -0.1003,
-0.1006 \}$ which seems to be repulsive.  It looks like $x = 0$ is an unstable
repulsive fixed point.

## 1.2(c)

$f(x) = x - x^3$ has a attractive fixed point at $0$, and $f'(0) = 1 - 3x^2|_0 = 1$

## 1.2(d)

$f(x) = x^3 + x$ has a repulsive fixed point at $0$, and $f'(0) = 3x^2 + 1|_0 = 1$

## 1.3

Let, $f(x) = x$
$$\begin{aligned}
x &= x^3 + x \\
x^3 &= 0 \\
x &= 0
\end{aligned}$$

The only fixed point is $x = 0$.  
For all $x > 0$, $f(x) = x^3 + x > x$  
For all $x < 0$, $f(x) = x^3 + x < x$ 

So $x = 0$ is a repulsive fixed point.
