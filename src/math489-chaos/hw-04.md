# 3.3

Assuming the interval $[0, 1]$ for $G(x)$
and $(-\sqrt 2, \sqrt 2)$ for $f(x)$.

$G(x) = 4x(1 - x^2) = 4x - 4x^2$

There is a Conjugacy: $C(x) = 2 \sqrt 2 x - 2$, $C ^{-1} = \frac 1 {2\sqrt 2} (x
+\sqrt 2)$

By theorem 3.13 we had shown that there are chaotic orbits on $G$. So by
conjugacy we can show that there are chaotic orbits on $g$.

A countable set of points on $G$ have periodic orbits, which are countable.
These are all sources. So any orbid that is not eventually periodic must be
chaotic.
