a.  $$\begin{aligned}
    f(x) &= x^4 + 2x^2 + 2 \\
    g(x) &= x^3 - 4x^2 - 4x \\
    D &= 2^9
    \end{aligned}$$

    $$\begin{aligned}
    g(x) &= (x)(x^2 - 4x - 4) \\
         &= (x)(x - (2\sqrt 2- 2))(x - (2\sqrt 2+ 2))
    \end{aligned}$$

    Since $g(x)$ is reducible in $\Q(16 \sqrt 2)$, $G = C = \Z_4 = <(1234)>$
    
b.  $$\begin{aligned}
    f(x) &= x^4 + 2x^2 + x + 2 \\
    g(x) &= x^3 - 4x^2 +-4x^2 + 1 \\
    D &= 3\cdot 7^3
    \end{aligned}$$
    
    $g(x) = (x + 1) (x - (\frac 5 2 - \frac {\sqrt {21}} 2))(x - (\frac 5 2 + \frac {\sqrt {21}} 2))$ 
    is reducible in $\Q[x]$. $g(x)$ is reducible in $\Q(7\sqrt{21})$
    so $G = C = \Z_4$.

c.  $$\begin{aligned}
    f(x) &= x^4 + 2x + 2 \\
    g(x) &= x^3 - 8x+ 4 \\
    D &= 2^4 \cdot 101
    \end{aligned}$$

    Since $g(x)$ has no root in $\Q$, and $\deg(g(x)) = 3 \implies g(x)$
    is irreducible in $\Q[x]$.
    Since $D$ is not a square, $G = S_4$ 

d.  $$\begin{aligned}
    f(x) &= x^4 + 2x^3 + xx^2 \\
    g(x) &= x^3 -x^2 - 9 x + 1 \\
    D &= 2^6 \cdot 7 ^2
    \end{aligned}$$
    
    $g(x)$ has no root in $\Q$, irreducible of degree 3 $\implies$ irreducible
    in $\Q[x]$.
    $D$ is a square so $G = A_4$

e.  $$\begin{aligned}
    f(x) &= x^4 - 4x^2 + 2 \\
    g(x) &= x^3 + 8x^2 + 8x \\
    D &= 2^11
    \end{aligned}$$
    
    $g(x) = (x) (x - (-4 -2 \sqrt{2}))(x - (-4 +2 \sqrt{2}))$, reducible in $\Q[x]$.
    
    $2 \sqrt 2 = \frac 1 {2^4} 2^5 \sqrt 2$, so $g(x)$ is reducible in $\Q(2^5 \sqrt 2)$.

f.  $$\begin{aligned}
    f(x) &= x^4 - 2x^2 + 4 \\
    g(x) &= x^3 + 4x^2 - 12 x \\
    D &= 2^{10}3^2
    \end{aligned}$$

    $g(x) = (x)(x+6)(x-2)$ factors completely in $\Q[x]$, so $G = V$, the Klein 4 group.

$S_4$ acts on $E/\Q$ by permuting the roots of $f(x)$. Without loss of
genereality, let $(12)$ transpose $\alpha_1$ and $\alpha_2$ and so on.
Then, the groups fixing $\alpha_1 + \alpha_2$ are generated by subsets of
$(12), (34)$.

By the fundamental theorem of Galois Theory, there is a bijection
between the subfields of $E$ containing $\Q$ and the subgroups of $S_4$:

$$\begin{aligned}
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
\end{aligned}$$

Since $B = \Q(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2)$ by definition is the smallest field
containing $\alpha_1 + \alpha_2$, it cannot by contained in $M$, $N$ or $O$.
i.e. it must be $X$. The bijection maps this to $\langle(1 2), (3 4)\rangle$.
So $[E : B ] = |\langle(1 2), (3 4)\rangle| = 4$, giving us $[B : \Q] = \frac {|S_4| 
} {4} = 6$.

From the bijection, we se that the subfields of $B$ correspond to
$D_8 \iso \langle (1 3 2 4), (1 2)\rangle = Y$ and $S_4$.

$[ E : Y ] = |D_8| = 8$, and $[Y : \Q] = \frac {|S_4|} {|D_8|} = \frac {24 } 8 = 3$
and $[\Q : \Q] = 1$
