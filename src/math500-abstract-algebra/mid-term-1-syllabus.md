* means: all bold items in the section
  (Definitions, Theorems, Propositions, Corollaries)
  except Examples (read and study those as necessary 
  to understand the material)

(3.2)  Prop 14, Cor 15
(3.3)  Isomorphism Theorems
       Know how to use all four versions

(4.1)* Group actions
       Know the groups S_n, A_n, D_2n
 
       Two elements in S_n are conjugate if and only if 
       they have the same cycle decomposition
       

(4.2)* Cont.
       Know how to prove Cor 5     

(4.3)  Action by conjugation
       * up to Conjugacy in S_n
       Know how to prove Thm 7, Thm 8, Cor 9
       
       From Conjugacy in S_n: know 
       that two elements in S_n are conjugate if and only if 
       they have the same cycle decomposition
       that A5 is simple and know its conjugacy classes

(4.5)  Sylow's Theorem
       * up to Applications of Sylow's subgroups

       Understand all proofs in Applications of Sylow's Theorem: 
       Example (Groups of order 30) and Proposition 23

(4.6)  Know Theorem 24.

(3.4)  Definition of composition series
       Know Theorem 22 (Jordan-H"older)
       Know Schreier Refinement Theorem (not in book)
       Know that Theorem 22 has a proof that combines
       Schreier Refinement Theorem with 
       Zassenhaus Lemma (Butterfly Lemma)
       Definition of solvable group

(6.1)  * p-groups, nilpotent groups and solvable groups
           (but skip Proposition 5 and Proposition 10, 
           read Theorem 11, skip A proof of the Fundamental 
           Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups)
       Note (changing definition and theorem): The definition in
       Section 3.4 and Theorem 9 give different characterizations
       of a solvable group. With the theorem they are equivalent
       and either characterization can be chosen as definition.

       Proofs: Understand all proofs up to and including Proposition 7.
       
       XXXX Proofs Frattini's Arg

(6.2)  Be able to use the arguments that are used to prove that 
       groups of certain order are not simple for each of
       |G| = 105, 3393, 396, 264, 1785 (as done in class)
       Know how to count p-Sylow subgroups in S_k, A_k.
