Modular arithmatic works fine, even for negative number, since

$$ -1 \equiv n - 1 (mod -n) $$


Also, even if $-1$ was a prime number, $-n$ where $n \ne 1$ is not. 


$$(p - 1)(q - 1)$$

RSA needs more bits to be as strong as other encryption, because there are only
so few primes below 2^2048

$$log_2(2^n *n) = log_2(2^n) + log_2(n) = n + log_2(n)$$

The 65,536th prime is 821,641.
